# Project_2

This project provides visualization of Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) admissions across 5 years. Data sets from SAMHSA.gov are used to create a PostgreSql database. This database is then queried in a Python Flask-powered API to create a JSON output of the admissions data across US states by year. This output is used to create a visualization using the Plotly library in Javascript.
