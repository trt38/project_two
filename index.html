    <h1>OUD Treatment Admissions by State</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2>Opioid Use Disorder</h2> 
    <p>The DSM-5 defines Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) as "problematic pattern of opioid use leading to clinically significant impairment or distress". 
        OUD is commonly referred to as "Opioid Abuse" or "Opioid Addiction". In the United States, approximmately 11.5 million people self-reported
        that they had used prescribed opioids in a manner other than directed in 2016 (CDC.gov). Unfortunately, access to treatment for OUD does not 
        meet the demand in many areas. This can contribute to self-medication, opioid-related complications, and opioid-related deaths. Below, you can 
        view the number of admissions to OUD treatment programs as reported by SAMHSA.gov.
